# Simon Says Game Instructions
Welcome to the Simon Says Game, an engaging and challenging memory game. Test your memory and attention skills by observing and repeating increasingly complex patterns.

## Getting Started
Download: To dive into the fun, download the JAR file from this repo and get ready to test your memory!

## How to Play
Observe the Pattern: When you start a round, watch the sequence in which the lights blink. Each color represents a part of the pattern you need to remember.
Repeat the Sequence: After the pattern stops blinking, it's your turn. Click on the colors in the exact order they were shown.
Progress Through Levels: Each round retains the pattern from the previous round but adds one additional blink at the end. This incremental increase in complexity challenges your memory as you progress through the game.

## Game Features
Incremental Difficulty: The pattern grows by one blink each round, making the game more challenging and engaging as you advance.
Memory Enhancement: This game is a great way to improve your memory and concentration skills.

## Tips
Take your time to memorize the pattern.
Focus on the order and the color of the lights for better recall.
As the game progresses, the patterns will become more complex, so stay attentive!
We hope you enjoy playing the Simon Says Game as much as we enjoyed creating it. Challenge your memory and have fun!
